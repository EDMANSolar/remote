R. Urraca, J. Antonanzas, F.J. Martinez-de-Pison and F. Antonanzas-Torres, 2015. Estimation of solar global irradiation in remote areas. Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy (under review)
Code to estimate daily solar global irradiation on a horizontal plane by means of soft computing techniques:  artificial neural networks- multilayer perceptron (ANN), regression trees (M5P), extreme learning machines (ELM) and support vector regression (SVR). Additionally it is also provided the code to estimate daily solar global irradiation with two parametric models Liu & Scott (2001) and Antonanzas-Torres et al. (2013).
